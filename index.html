<p>When I graduated high school, I went to the University of Illinois for a year, before deciding I wanted to do something more music-based.  I got a job at a music store and got an internship at a recording studio in Chicago called I.V. Labs (so called because the main studio room was In an old bank Vault).  I also got a job as a stagehand at a local music venue called The Pearl Room.  From these gigs I started freelancing for different bands and venues in the Chicago area, and worked at a stage manager and sound tech for a few years until 2011, when I decided to go back to school.</p>
<p>I came to Grand Valley for the cheap tuition and the engineering program, my stage and sound work inspiring me to go into electrical engineering for equipment design.  Along the way, the coursework at which I was best and in which I had the most fun were my programming and digital systems classes.  So I switched to Computer Science in the Fall of 2013, and have loved it ever since.</p>
